# **Neural Network Model Optimization Report**
# **Overview of the analysis:**
The pourpse of this analysis was to develop a tool that helps select applicants for funding with the highest chances of sucsess.

In the initial model, I used the starting criteria that was provided and achieved an accuracy of about 75% In the optimized model, serveral data attributes were adjusted and the model accuracy improved to over 77%.

# **Summary**
Overall, I was able to get about 75% accuracy by using the original model, but by increasing the nuerons, layers, and activation functions, I was able to increase the accruacy to of 77%. This number can be increased by continuing to add more values but comes at a cost since in doing so will also increase the cost of general expenses since this model is more expensive.
